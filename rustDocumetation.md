## Rust Socket Server Overview

This crate is the moved/renamed version of the old `rust_server` crate.
It exposes the same HTTP + WebSocket APIs, but now lives under `rust_socket/`.

See the original documentation in `../rust_server/rustDocumetation.md` for a detailed explanation
of endpoints, middleware, and WebSocket flow. All paths and behavior are identical; only the crate
name and folder changed.
